# CV_with_AI
 Using AI to adjust for ATS

Disclaimer:
As with any generative AI tool, please check your results. 

Usage:
1- File: CV Bullets.txt
1.1- For each line, write {tag from company}:{your experiences there}.
2. File: CV Base ATS cod.docx
2.1- Get all your template ready with your companies, graduation, certificates and more. There's 2 tags already there. Copy paste and adjust the {} if you need more. The routine will locate them and paste
3- After getting your description in TXT and template in DOCX ready, run main.py
4- Copy the job description. You need to insert in a single line (Note: if I ever make a 1.1 version, I'll create some GUI for simplification)
5- Now wait. When it's done, check if the updates, rename the file as you please, anbd good luck
